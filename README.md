YouTube API project using the Scorpio Sun Scorpio Moon YouTube Channel



# The Data Source

The data comes from Scorpio Sun Scoprio Moon's YouTube channel via YouTube's API. The YouTube channel is here: https://www.youtube.com/@ScorpioSunScorpioMoon


# The Data

Channel statistics including video_id, channelTitle, title, description (video description), tags, publishedAt, viewCount, likeCount, favoriteCount, duration, definition (standard definition, high definition etc.), and caption (true/false). 

# Evaluation

Consistent with many YouTube channels, only a handful of videos drive a channel's success. For ScorpioSunScorpioMoon, the best performing videos are video topics non-Scorpios find interesting, not necessarily Scorpios. The worst performing videos are nearly all videos from Scorpio Season 2021 Transformation series and one (the best of the worst) is from the 2022 Scorpio Season 2022 series. This series was targeted to Scorpios -- primarily in the area of Scorpio empowerment. 

The top five performing videos are:
 1) Scorpio is the Strongest Sign of the Zodiac
 2) 4 Zodiac Signs That are Bad for Scorpios
 3) Why Scoprios Disappear and Maintain Power
 4) Things You Will Never Understand About a Scorpio
 5) 5 Things Scorpios Don't Care About But You Think They Do 


# Future Projects

Here are my some ideas to expand on this type of project:

Text analysis for video comments from viewers. 
Time series analysis on video metrics like video duration 
Deep dive data visualization in Python, Power BI or Tableau.
